# libft
First project of the 42 curriculum, where you have to create a library with 52 mandatory functions from basic to average in complexity.

**This project was initially made in three weeks. But it's still being iterated over.**  

In development **1.3.0**  
planned fatures:  

- new folder and naming structures;
- new Makefile structure to compile different functions individually;
- add functions made for other projects like graphical functions from `fdf` and linked list functions from `push_swap`

This verions purpose is to have a complete header full of all the funcions i have created during my 42 projects, being useful for more complex projects like `minishel` and `minirt`, while also being a central hub of my favorite codes.
